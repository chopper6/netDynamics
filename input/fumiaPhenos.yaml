# from fumia paper:
# cell phenotypes: apoptotic, characterized by active caspases; 
# glycolytic, with H1f1 activated under normoxia;
# immortalized, in which hTert is active; migratory, associated to inactivate E cadherin;
# mutator, corresponding to inactive Atm/Atr proteins in the presence of DNA damage; 
# proliferative, in which cyclins are activated along the cell cycle in the correct sequence; 
# and quiescent, with cyclins inactive or activated in a wrong sequence.
