# specifies which nodes are 'outputs' and determine the phenotype

outputs : ['Apop','Prolif','Quiesc']
# will produce output phenotypes in terms of these
inputs : ['Mutagen','Nutrients','GFs','Hypoxia','Gli','TNFalpha']
# will try all combinations of inputs ONLY IF mult.py is uses

statics : {'G1':0, 'G2':0, 'S':0, 'M':0,'Prolif':0,'Apop':0,'Quiesc':1}
mutations : {'VHL':0}
# each initial sample is the same for the statics
# the above are highly recommended statics for fumia
# inputs can also be used as statics

pheno_color_map : {'100':1,'010':0,'001':2} #to ensure consistent coloring between images

# from fumia paper:
# cell phenotypes: apoptotic, characterized by active caspases; 
# glycolytic, with H1f1 activated under normoxia;
# immortalized, in which hTert is active; migratory, associated to inactivate E cadherin;
# mutator, corresponding to inactive Atm/Atr proteins in the presence of DNA damage; 
# proliferative, in which cyclins are activated along the cell cycle in the correct sequence; 
# and quiescent, with cyclins inactive or activated in a wrong sequence.
